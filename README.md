# Advent of Code (2023)
My solutions and notes for Advent of Code 2023

## Day 1 - Trebuchet
The first part was relatively simple, but the second required me to dive into regex and how it handles multiple matches. I ended up referencing [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1884fpl/2023_day_1for_those_who_stuck_on_part_2/) for more example inputs to test. I know there are more efficient ways of solving this, but until performance is an issue, I won't bother too much about it.
